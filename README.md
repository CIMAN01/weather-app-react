# weather-app-react

A beautiful but simple weather app that I ported from vanilla Javascript (refer to my previous repo) to React. 
It looks and behaves exactly as the plain javascript app with only minor changes implemented. 

For best experience, Edge broswer should be used (currently Firefox has issues with displaying suggestions properly). 

This is how the app looks on a 13 inch laptop:

City suggestions is implemented via an API when searching for a city:
